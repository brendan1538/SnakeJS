# SnakeJS
Quick recreation of the classic snake game with JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. 

<h2>VERSION 1.1</h2>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
To start game, press space bar. Arrow keys turn the snake and score is kept at bottom right of canvas. If you crash into the walls or your tail, you can press spacebar to restart (I'm currently working out some bugs with this functionality).

<h3>Version 1.1 <b>Updates</b></h3>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
1. Fixed issue where snake could not travel along right or bottom of the gameplay screen.
2. Also resolved an issue where, after hitting the top of the screen and pressing space to restart multiple times, food would render repeatedly and the snake could not move.
